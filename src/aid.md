Challenge:
/**
   * Challenge: Make the HostLayout component!
   * The HostLayout should use Links to navigate to the following
   * routes: 
   *    * Dashboard ("/host")
   *    * Income ("/host/income")
   *    * Reviews ("/host/reviews")
   * Then replace the parent "/host" route's element below with the
   * new HostLayout component you made.
   * 
   * NOTE: The dashboard route/page will be gone for now, but don't fret.
   * We'll be fixing that in the next lesson.
